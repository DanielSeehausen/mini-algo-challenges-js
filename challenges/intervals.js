/* For this challenge, we are going to solve Euler 14 (a.k.a. Longest Collatz Sequence)
 * The prompt is available here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=14
 * and here:
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 *
 * n → n/2 (n is even)
 * n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 *
 * 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * QUESTION: Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 * NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
 *
 * Once you have a working solution, refactor to implement the following (if not already present)
 * 1.) Get your solution running in under 2 seconds: don't recalculate any integer's iterations until 1 more than once
 * 2.) Use an array instead of hash/dict/js object/associative array. If you completed step 1 this will make sense.
 * 3.) Determine whether your solution runs quicker using an array. If not, make a change that enables it to run quicker. Feel free to use google to better understand how arrays handle resizing, but not in the context of Euler p.14!
